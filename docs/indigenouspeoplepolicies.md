# Indigenous Peoples Policies
Unity shall bring tribes back to the table in a way that is more favorable to their communities in the following ways

## Indigenous Courts
Unity will make it so the indigenous courts are integrated with Federal Courts in order to better uphold their legal opinions

## Congressional Representation
Unity shall guarantee that indigenous communities receive congressional representation in parliament.

## Reparations
Unity will pay reparations to indigenous communities for the following atrocities: the ethnic cleansing/genocide of indigenous communities, the indoctrination of indigenous communities as a result of the Dawes Act, and war crimes/human rights violations committed against these communities. This shall be determined by the value generated on the land since seizure plus interest, and the value of each person killed calculated by inflation up to the date.

# Our Economic & Trade Policies

## Worker Controlled
Workers should have the ability to control what happens in their workplace and take control of the goods and services they produce. Unity will guarantee the rights of direct democratic unions and promote the growth of worker-run co-ops.

## Against Explotation
For too long our political and economic systems have been gripped and exploited by corporate monopoly. Unity will end that by taking aggressive action to break up modern tech monopolies and trusts. Unity shall pursue that at least 50% of boards be represented by the worker unions.

## Right to Quality Life
Everyone has the right to a quality healthy life, and yet again for too long we have failed to act. Unity shall propose policy to pursue a single payer healthcare option.

## Jobs Stay Home
The workers of our society have seen their jobs ravaged and moved overseas, to be taken over by exploited workers abused by their state and corporations. This ends now. Unity shall pursue multilateral trade agreements which utilize our economic leverage to create and defend good American jobs, raise wages and farm income, combat climate change, lower drug prices, and improve living standards worldwide. Unity will accomplish this through the creation of labor and environmental enforcement mechanisms within the trade agreements that effectively enforce labor rights, uphold internationally recognized human rights, and promote international green policies.

## Break Economic Racism
Black/POC communities for far too long have been ravaged and plundered by a racist economic structure that has trapped them in poverty. To address this, Unity will invest in POC entrepreneurial enterprises, local infrastructure, land improvements, and replacing property tax funded schooling in order to ensure equitable access to education

## Reduce Poverty
Unity will expand poverty reduction programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, SNAP, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children with the express aim at creating a social safety net that ends extreme poverty and provides the fundamental resources necessary to live a dignified life.

## Improve Worker Rights
Unity pledges to improve worker rights by guaranteeing paid personal/family/medical leave, requiring predictable scheduling, eliminating discrimination in hiring, promotion, and pay.

## Support Our Troops
Veterans have been left out in the cold for too many years now after fighting in 3 wars in the last 30 years. Unity will act to reform the Tri-Care health system to cover all medical expenses, including dental/eye/mental health care. Unity will also guarantee full ride scholarships to any college or university for veterans. Unity will reform the veterans care system to become integrated with the military instead of having a separate program, to mainstream the process. Veterans will also be given permanent access to in base housing if they've served their full term or faced early retirement due to mental or physical injury.

## Right to Education
The right to a quality education should be the right of all people. Unity will pursue universal pre-k/child education as well as a minimum of 2 years of community college.

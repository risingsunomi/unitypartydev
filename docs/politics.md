# Our Politics

## Unity will be divided into 6 caucuses
- The Liberals 
- The Social Democrats 
- The Democratic Socialist 
- The Market Socialist 
- The Communist (No Tankies)
- Unity POC Caucus 

## Party Primaries
Party Primaries will be held the week following Unityâ€™s establishment in which each caucus will elect leadership. That leadership shall consist of Caucus Leader, Deputy Leader, Whip, and additionally a Prime Ministerial candidate. Three days after this there shall be a debate amongst caucuses and a vote for who will lead Unity into the election. 

## POC Representation
Unity shall guarantee that POC gets a seat at the table. For far too long the POC of the Politics.gg server have been left out of the conversation, therefore we have established a caucus for POC to have a real tangible seat at the table.

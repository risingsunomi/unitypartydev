# Foreign Policy

## Focus on Democracy
Unity pledges to implement a foreign policy which focuses on democracy, human rights, diplomacy and peace. This entails a new Conventional Arms Transfer Policy that prioritizes human rights and international humanitarian law, requires a risk assessment of all planned arm sales, and strengthens end-use monitoring to include human rights, corruption, and civilian harm. This entails a scaling back of our military overreach throughout the globe, ending our commitment to endless war, and ending our support of allies engaged in human rights violations

## Iran Nuclear Deal
Unity pledges to reenter the Iran Nuclear Deal in order to prevent nuclear proliferation, deescalate tensions, and pursue rapprochement with Iran.

# Funding Unity

- Medicare for All ($1.2 trillion annually. See the bottom for how I came to this number)
- Social Security expansion ($120 billion annually)
- Paid family/maternal leave ($32 billion annually)
- Rebuild our infrastructure ($2.064 investment by 2025. Source is at the bottom.).

### The U.S economy
While total government revenue will account for around $6.54 trillion and deficit spending accounted for $779 billion in 2018 (together, 34.85% of the economy). If we adopted Medicare for All, Social Security expansion, and paid family/maternal leave, 41.67% of our GDP would be publicly owned or “socialist”. 58.33% of our economy would still be capitalist instead of 65.15%.<br />

### Spending
We could pay for the four permanent spending proposals (Medicare for All, Social Security expansion, and paid family/maternal leave) TWICE over if we wanted to, while also being able to fully fund the $2.064 trillion needed by 2025 to rebuild our infrastructure by selectively picking from the following 20 revenue streams:

### Employer Healthcare
$390 billion could be raised a year from a 7.5 percent income-based health care premium paid by employers. An employer’s first $2 million in payroll would be exempt from this premium protecting small businesses throughout the country.<br/>[Source](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/options-to-finance-medicare-for-all?inline=file)

### Income Based Premium
$350 billion could be raised a year from a 4 percent income-based premium paid by households making above $29,000. Meaning this 4% tax would only apply to every $1 a household makes over $29,000.<br />[Source](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/options-to-finance-medicare-for-all?inline=file)

### Progressive Marginal Income Tax
$180 billion could be raised a year by implementing the following progressive marginal income tax rates (These are for single-filers. It’d be double this for married couples):

- 45 percent on income between $500,000 and $2 million.
- 50 percent on income between $2 million and $10 million. (In 2014, only 136,000 households, the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers, had income between $2 million and $10 million.)
- 52 percent on income above $10 million. (In 2014, only 16,700 households, just 0.02 percent of taxpayers, had income exceeding $10 million.)

### Revenue Stream and Spending
All of these revenue streams together come out to $2.954 trillion dollars. The permanent spending proposals I’d like to see us adopt cost $1.432 trillion, so we could fully fund those 4 public programs TWICE with extra money left over from these listed revenue streams. It would also be easy enough to choose from the revenue streams and fund the addition of rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure ($2.064). Below are the benefits of adopting the five spending proposals:
- Medicare for All
  - It would cost $0 out of pocket for: Medical care, dental care, vision care, long-term care, and hearings aids.
  - Every single American would have quality health insurance.
  - There would be no more: private health insurance premiums, deductibles, and copays.
  - Americans would be paying less for prescription drugs.
  - Having health insurance would no longer be tied to having a job.
  - The average American family would save thousands on medical bills every year.
  - More than six hundred thousand Americans would no longer file for medical bankruptcy every year.
  - Tens of thousands of Americans would no longer die every year because due to not being able to afford healthcare.
- Social Security expansion:
  - The legislation associated with this would increase Social Security benefits by about $1,300 annually for seniors who make less than $16,000.
  - The legislation associated with this would increase monthly payments for most beneficiaries by $43 per month starting at age 80 and $73 at age 90.
  - The legislation associated with this would extend Social Security’s solvency to 2078.
- Paid family/maternal leave:
  - The legislation associated with this would provide workers with up to 12 weeks of partial income (66% of their monthly salary) when they take time for their own serious health conditions, including pregnancy and childbirth recovery; the serious health condition of a child, parent, spouse or domestic partner; the birth or adoption of a child; and/or for particular military caregiving and leave purposes.
- Rebuilding U.S infrastructure:
  - $3.9 trillion added to the U.S. GDP by 2025.
  - $7 trillion in additional business sales by 2025.
  - 2.5 million more American jobs created by 2025.
  - American families would incur $3,400 more in disposable income each year (about $9 each day).

### Healthcare Spending
**NOTE: The $1.2 trillion number for Medicare for All accounts for replacing people’s private health insurance and insuring the uninsured. We already publicly finance around two-thirds of our healthcare through federal, state, and local taxes.**<br />[Source](https://www.americanactionforum.org/weekly-checkup/nearly-two-thirds-u-s-health-care-costs-financed-taxpayers/)

In 2017, the U.S’s total healthcare spending was around $3.5 trillion.<br />[Source](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nhe-fact-sheet.html)

Doing some math there $3.5 trillion x 0.66% = $2.31 trillion. I then did $3.5 trillion - $2.31 trillion = $1.19 trillion or around $1.2 trillion as I listed.
So the $1.2 trillion is implying that this is how much money would need to be generated through new taxes to finance the program on top of what the government already collects in taxes.

What’s even better is two recent studies suggest that moving to a Medicare for All single-payer program would actually reduce spending on healthcare in the U.S.
The Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) says we could save $5.1 trillion over 10 years. <br />[Source](https://www.peri.umass.edu/publication/item/download/805_42f6acc20a83c79049e68b270e30ee43)

# Environmental Policies
Unity shall ensure that our economy is carbon neutral in the next 10 years by taking the following steps

## Infrastructure
Passing an infrastructure bill that will restructure and update our highway system to be more conservative in land usage, invest in alternative transportation methods such as high speed rail, metros, bike lanes, subways, and other methods.

## Tax Credit
Unity will provide a generous tax credit for every household to be able to afford an electric vehicle in the next 5 years. We will do this by providing subsidies in order to cultivate R&D and vehicular manufacturing in this country.

## National Parks
Unity will work to not only restore national parks, but also expand them. Unity will also introduce the first marine park system to ensure our coast line and reefs are properly protected

## Protect Our Seas
Unity will end the practice of large fishing fleets from exploiting and plundering our seas and coastlines, we will help cultivate local fisheries to fish responsibly on our shores instead. Unity will advocate for the use of fish hatcheries as a greener way of supporting local fisheries.

## Clean Energy
Unity will heavily invest in clean energy research, create manufacturing jobs through a federal commitment to purchase American-made renewable energy products, and emphasize the usage of our trade networks to sell our products abroad.

## Renewable Energy
Unity will make it a priority to invest in transitioning to alternative renewable energies, utilizing an aggressive combination of regulatory standards, subsidies, and a carbon tax scheme to ensure 100% clean electricity, vehicles, buildings by 2035. 

## Fossil Fuels
Unity will ensure an equitable transition for existing fossil fuel industry workers and frontline communities by prioritizing resources, conditioning clean energy investments to expanded technical/trade school/apprenticeship training, and conditioning federal clean energy investments to employers offering family-supporting wages and benefits.
